        <center><p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually<br> 
           refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software<br>
           development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop<br>
           browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has<br>
           become ever-increasingly important.</p></center>
